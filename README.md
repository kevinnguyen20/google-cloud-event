Hey there! Ever noticed how cloud computing seems to be everywhere these days? Well, we're kicking off our Cloud Computing Series, and you're invited to the very first event!

In this session, we'll break down the basics of cloud computing and introduce you to the wonders of Google Cloud Platform. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or just dipping your toes into computer science, this is the perfect starting point. We'll cover all the cool stuff Google has to offer, giving you a peek into the latest trends and together we will build our first REST API in Google Cloud Platform.
